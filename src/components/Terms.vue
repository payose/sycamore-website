              <h4><strong>Cookies</strong></h4>

              <p>
                Like many other websites, we use cookies to identify you as a
                user and to customize and improve our services. A cookie is a
                small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile

              <p>
                Some browsers may automatically accept cookies while some can be

                cookies, it may limit your ability to use our website.
              </p>

              <h4><strong>Governing Law</strong></h4>

              <p>
                These Terms shall be interpreted and governed in accordance with
                the Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and you submit to
                the exclusive jurisdiction of the Nigerian Courts for the
                resolution of any dispute.
              </p>

              <h4><strong>General</strong></h4>

              <p>
                We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will
                not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms
                which will always be on www.Sycamore.com will govern our
                relationship with you. We will also try to notify you of any
                material changes which could be done via email associated with
                your account or service notification. By continuing to use our
                services after the changes become effective, you agree to be
                bound by the revised Terms.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the event that any of these Terms is held to be invalid or
                unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated
                to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of
                these Terms will remain in full effect. Sycamore’s failure to
                enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed
                a waiver of such right or provision.
