                on legitimate interests, you have the right to object at any
                time.

              <h4><strong>AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING</strong></h4>

              <p>
                We use an automated decision making system to make automated

                sending you emails that are relevant to you, and so we will use
                your personal information to determine which content you may be
                more interested in receiving.
